A man walks into a bar. He has 47 dollars but owes his best friend 25 for a favor he did last Tuesday in which the man borrowed his friend's hedge-clippers and then totally ruined them by trying to cut down a walnut tree. If he buys a $5 beer and tips the bartender a dollar, how many more beers could he buy while making sure he can still pay back his friend?=3#
